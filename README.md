🚧 Road Accident Analysis Dashboard – Power BI

This project presents a detailed analysis of road accidents using interactive dashboards built with **Power BI**. The goal is to identify
key patterns, trends, and risk factors related to road accidents and to provide actionable insights for improving road safety.

 📊 Dashboard Features

- **Accident Trends** by Year, Month, and Day of Week
- **Severity Breakdown**: Minor, Serious, Fatal
- **Accidents by Location**: State and City-wise analysis
- **Driver Insights**: Age, Gender, License status, Alcohol involvement
- **Environmental Conditions**: Weather, Road Type, Lighting, Speed
- **Vehicle Types Involved** and casualty impact

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Power BI Desktop** – Dashboard creation and data modeling
- **Power Query Editor** – Data cleaning and transformation
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – Measures for KPIs and time-based analysis

---

📌 Key Insights Identified

- **Alcohol Involvement** and **invalid licenses** correlate with high fatality rates.
- Poor weather and lighting conditions (e.g., foggy mornings, wet roads) show increased accident severity.
- Accidents on **national highways** are often more serious due to higher speeds.
- Most minor accidents occur in **urban areas** during daytime hours.

---

## 📈 Target Users

- Road safety authorities and urban planners
- Policy makers for transportation and law enforcement
- NGOs and researchers studying traffic-related issues

---

🚀 Future Enhancements

- Integrate real-time traffic accident feeds via public APIs
- Add forecasting using Python + Power BI integration
- Geospatial mapping (latitude/longitude) for deeper location insights
